                K/DA is one of the most innovative and culturally influential projects ever introduced in the League of Legends universe. The project, which blends the worlds of gaming and music, features a virtual K-pop girl group that has become a phenomenon in its own right. The group, named K/DA, is composed of iconic League of Legends champions, each reimagined as K-pop idols. The group debuted in 2018, but it quickly garnered global attention, combining catchy music, stunning visuals, and the massive League of Legends fanbase into a global entertainment event.

                These champions were selected due to their personalities, which align with the K-pop image. Ahri’s enchanting allure, Akali’s rebellious attitude, and Kai’Sa’s edgy yet glamorous aura all fit the bill for a virtual music group. Evelynn, with her seductive charm, completed the initial lineup. Each champion was given unique K-pop-inspired outfits, and their personalities were further shaped to fit the group's theme.

                The first single from K/DA, titled "POP/STARS," was released in November 2018. The song was a massive hit, with over 100 million views on YouTube within the first few weeks of release. POP/STARS blended K-pop's infectious hooks and slick choreography with League of Legends' signature style, creating a musical piece that appealed to both gamers and music lovers.

                In 2020, K/DA returned with new music, further solidifying their presence in the music scene. The release of "THE BADDIE" was accompanied by the debut of Seraphine, a new champion introduced as a member of K/DA. The song and its accompanying visuals showcased a more mature, edgy side of the group while still staying true to their K-pop roots.
